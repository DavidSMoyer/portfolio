    An easy way to tell if a webpage is secure is to check it’s URL. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the 
    protocol used on the internet to send webpages to users. This, however, is unsecure and unencrypted. Any 
    information sent over HTTP is at risk of being stolen. HTTPS was created to eliminate this problem. The S on 
    HTTPS stands for “Secure”, meaning that any information sent over HTTPS is encrypted. You shouldn’t give 
    sensitive information to a website that has a URL starting with http. If the URL starts with https that means 
    that the web page that you are on has a secure connection. A secure website means that any information you 
    give it is encrypted, making it much harder for attackers to obtain your data. Otherwise, your information 
    would be displayed in plaintext and easily obtained.

    Usually, HTTPS is secured using either Secure Socket Layer (SSH) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). Secure 
    Socket Layer is the standard protocol used to secure an internet connection between two locations, protecting 
    the information from any malicious users attempting to obtain the data. SSL protects this information by 
    encrypting the data that is sent. Encrypting data converts it from plain, readable text into “cipher text” 
    that only the secret, shared key can decrypt. Secure protocols encrypt sensitive information before sending 
    it across the internet, where it is decrypted when it reaches it’s destination. Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
    is just a more updated version of SSL, however is still referred to as an SSL certificate. SSL certificates 
    are given to domains from an entity known as SSL Certificate Authority. SSL Certificate Authority is trusted 
    to be in “charge” of giving or revoking SSL certificates to other entities. These certificates verify that the 
    entity is who they say they are, as well as applying SSL security to their processes.

    The type of information you want to protect is any personal or sensitive data you own. For example, passwords, 
    addresses, phone number, certain identifying data. Companies must also be sure to secure any information they 
    send, like data for their users, hospital records, etc. If any of your personal information is stolen, 
    attackers could use these tidbits of information to access your online accounts like your bank account. 
    If they obtain enough identifying information, they could even steal your identity. As for companies, losing 
    any information to attackers could result in a number of lawsuits from users, as they were supposed to keep 
    that information confidential.
